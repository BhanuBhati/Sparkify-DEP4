# Sparkify Datalake using AWS EMR

## Introduction


A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

We are building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## The Datasets

The dataset we are using are stored at below S3 buckets:

* Song data: *s3://udacity-dend/song_data*
* Log data: *s3://udacity-dend/log_data*
* Log data json path: *s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json*

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
    
    song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

    {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema Details

We are going to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables: 

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page *NextSong*
    - This table will be stored in parquet files partitioned by year and month of record.

### Dimension Tables

1. **users** - users in the app
    - This table will be stored as parquet files.

        
2. **songs** - songs in music database
    - This table will be partioned by year and artist_id and will be stored as parquet files.

3. **artists** - artists in music database
    - This table will be stored as parquet files.

4. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - This table will be stored as parquet files partioned by year and month.

## Project Files

The project includes four files:

1. `etl.py` reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3
2. `dl.cfg` contains AWS credentials
3. `README.md` documents process and decisions

# ETL Process

## Step 1: Configure EMR cluster with the following settings:
* Release: `emr-5.20.0` or later
* Applications: `Spark: Spark 2.4.0` on Hadoop 2.8.5 YARN with Ganglia 3.7.2 and Zeppelin 0.8.0
* Instance type: `m3.xlarge`
* Number of instance: `3`
* EC2 key pair: `Proceed without an EC2 key pair` (Can also provide key-pair)
* Keep the remaining default setting and click "Create cluster" on the bottom right.
* Wait for the status of cluster to change from `Starting` to `Waiting`.

## Step 2: Create Notebook
* Cluster has been launched successfully, create a notebook to run Spark on the cluster.
* Select "Notebooks" in the menu on the left, and click the "Create notebook" button.
* Enter a name for your notebook
* Select `"Choose an existing cluster"` and choose the cluster you just created
* Use the default setting for `"AWS service role"` - this should be `"EMR_Notebooks_DefaultRole"` or `"Create default role"`.
* Keep the remaining default settings and click "Create notebook" on the bottom right.
* Wait for Notebook "Ready" Status, Then Open
* Once you create an EMR notebook, wait a short time before the notebook status changes from `Starting` or `Pending` to `Ready`. Once your notebook status is Ready, click the "Open" button to open the notebook.

The notebook is now ready to run the code.

## Step 3: Load data from S3

* Data can be loaded into spark system from input S3 buckets using

        df = spark.read.json(path)

## Step 4: Transform & Load Data

* Transform song data to get desired columns for songs and artist tables. Write these tables to parquet using

        table_name.write.mode('overwrite').partitionBy(partion_columns).parquet(output_path)

* Transform log data to get desired columns for time and user tables. Write these tables to parquet files.
* Read the song table from output bucket and join with log data to get all the data required for songplays table. Use `monotonically_increasing_id()` to generate songplay_id (We can also define a UDF for it).
* Select desired columns from joined table and write songplays table to parquet file.
