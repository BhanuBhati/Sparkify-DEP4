# Sparkify Datalake using AWS EMR

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

We are building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## The Datasets

The dataset we are using are stored at below S3 buckets:

* Song data: *s3://udacity-dend/song_data*
* Log data: *s3://udacity-dend/log_data*
* Log data json path: *s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json*

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. 
For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
    
    song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
    song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

    {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema Details

We are going to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables: 

### Staging Tables

1. **staging_events** - Stores the log data loaded from S3 Bucket. 
    - We are using ts (timestamp) as the SORTKEY. 

2. **staging_songs** - Stores the song data loaded from S3 Bucket. 
    - We are using year as the SORTKEY. 

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page *NextSong*
    - Using start time as both DISTKEY and SORTKEY.

### Dimension Tables

1. **users** - users in the app
    - This table will be small enough. We will be distributing it on ALL nodes.
        
2. **songs** - songs in music database
    - This table will be small enough. We will be distributing it on ALL nodes.

3. **artists** - artists in music database
    - This table will be small enough. We will be distributing it on ALL nodes.

4. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - This table will be small enough. We will be distributing it on ALL nodes.

## Project Files

The project includes four files:

1. `create_table.py` is where we are creating fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
2. `etl.py` is where we are loading data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then processing that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
3. `sql_queries.py` is where we are defining SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.
4. `README.md` for process and decisions of ETL pipeline.  
5. `dwh.cfg` containing AWS credentials and S3 Bucket locations.

# ETL Process

## Creating IAM Role, Sucurity Group and Redshift Cluster.
- First creating an IAM Role with `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` permission and Storing the Roles ARN in `dwh.cfg`. This is necessary for RedShift to be able to read S3 Bucket content.
- Then, creating a Security Group under EC2 > Network and Security and adding Inbound rule to allow all traffic from out current IP.
- Creating a Redshift Cluster. Upon successful creation, we are going to enable `Publicly accessible` under Cluster Network and Security Settings. 
- Then, adding the IAM Role created above to the cluster and changing default VPC to the security group created above. 
- Saving HOST, database name, username and password in `dwh.cfg`.

## Creating Tables

- Stating the DROP and CREATE statements in sql_queries.py
- Calling create_tables.py after this to drop all the tables first and create fresh ones. This process can be repeated multiple times while developing the database.

## Loading Staging Tables

- Loading the staging tables with the json data from S3 bucket. General syntax:

        COPY staging_events FROM S3_Bucket_location
        iam_role IAM_ARN
        COMPUPDATE OFF region 'us-west-2'
        json JSON_PATH
        TRUNCATECOLUMNS BLANKSASNULL EMPTYASNULL;
- COMPUPDATE OFF disables the compression computations which makes the data load faster into the table. This is optional.
- json JSON_PATH provides the JSON Path file location to be used. JSON Path file contains JSONPath expression which is used to traverse the path to an element in the JSON structure. We can use `json 'auto'` to leave this on RedShift.
- TRUNCATECOLUMNS BLANKSASNULL EMPTYASNULL converts blanks and empty values to NULLS in table. This is also optional.

## Loading Dimension and Fact Tables

### 1. Songs Table
- SELECTing distinct song_id, title, artist_id,year and duration FROM staging_songs and INSERTing in songs table.

        SELECT
            distinct song_id,
            title,
            artist_id,
            year,
            duration
        FROM
            staging_songs;


### 2. Artists Table
- SELECT distinct artist_id, artist_name, artist_location, artist_latitude and artist_longitude FROM staging_songs and INSERTing in artists table.

        SELECT
            distinct artist_id,
            artist_name,
            artist_location,
            artist_latitude,
            artist_longitude
        FROM
            staging_songs
        WHERE 
            artist_id IS NOT NULL;

### 3. Users Table
- The below query fetches the required user details from staging events. Only the most recent user details are being used in order to capture latest level of user whether it is free or paid.

        SELECT
            distinct user_id,
            first_name,
            last_name,
            gender,
            level
        FROM 
            staging_events
        WHERE
            user_id IS NOT NULL
        ORDER BY
            ts DESC;

### 4. Time Table
- Inserting the data we get from staging_events table with the below query:

        SELECT
            distinct timestamp 'epoch' + ts/1000 * interval '1 second' AS start,
            EXTRACT(hour FROM start),
            EXTRACT(day FROM start),
            EXTRACT(week FROM start),
            EXTRACT(month FROM start),
            EXTRACT(year FROM start),
            EXTRACT(weekday FROM start)
        FROM
            staging_events
        WHERE ts IS NOT NULL;
- There are multiple ways to get datetime from timestamp in milliseconds. Using `timestamp 'epoch' + ts/1000 * interval '1 second'` is the most efficient one.

### 5. Songplays Table
The below query retrieves the required data:

    SELECT
        timestamp 'epoch' + se.ts/1000 * interval '1 second',
        se.user_id,
        se.level,
        s.song_id,
        s.artist_id,
        se.location,
        se.sessionId,
        se.useragent
    FROM
        staging_events se
        LEFT JOIN songs s ON s.title = se.song and s.duration = se.length
    WHERE
        se.page = 'NextSong';

- We are inserting only records with page = NextSong
- JOINING songs and stagin_events Tables to get song_id and artist_id. Joining these two is fast since, songs table is distributed in ALL style.
